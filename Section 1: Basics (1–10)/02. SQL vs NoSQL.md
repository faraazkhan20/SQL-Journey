### Topic 2: SQL vs NoSQL

SQL and NoSQL are two broad types of database systems used to store and manage data, but they differ significantly in structure, flexibility, and use cases.

SQL databases are **relational**. They store data in tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a record, and columns represent attributes. This structure enforces a strict schema, meaning the data must follow a defined format. For example, in an SQL database, a table for users might look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Email VARCHAR(100),
  Age INT
);
```

This enforces that every user has an ID, Name, Email, and Age, each with a specific data type. SQL databases use **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to manipulate and query data, providing powerful tools for joins, filtering, and aggregation.

NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are **non-relational** and designed for flexibility and scalability. They don’t require a fixed schema, so you can store data in various formats like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. A popular example is MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database where data is stored in JSON-like objects:

```json
{
  "name": "Amit Sharma",
  "email": "amit@example.com",
  "age": 30,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "SQL", "React"]
}
```

This flexibility allows you to add or remove fields easily without changing the database structure, which is useful for evolving applications.

The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on your needs. SQL databases are great when data consistency and complex queries involving multiple tables are important. For example, banking systems prefer SQL for reliable transactions and integrity.

NoSQL databases excel with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and when you need horizontal scalability. They are often used in big data, real-time web apps, and content management systems.

Here’s a simple practical contrast:

* In SQL, to find users older than 25:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 25;
```

* In MongoDB (NoSQL), to find users older than 25:

```js
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
```

In summary, SQL databases emphasize structure, consistency, and complex querying, while NoSQL offers flexibility, scalability, and speed for diverse data types. Many modern systems use both, choosing the right tool per task.
