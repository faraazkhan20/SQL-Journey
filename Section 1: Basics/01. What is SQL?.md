### **Topic 1: What is SQL?**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to **create, read, update, and delete** (often abbreviated as **CRUD**) data in a database. SQL is declarative, meaning you describe **what** you want done, and the database engine figures out **how** to do it. This makes SQL easy to write and understand, even for beginners.

At its core, SQL is designed to work with **structured data**—data organized into tables with rows and columns. Each table usually represents one entity (like `Employees`, `Products`, or `Orders`), and each column represents an attribute of that entity (like `name`, `price`, or `date`).

Here’s a very simple example: imagine a table named `Employees` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Position VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

This SQL command creates a new table called `Employees` with four columns. Once created, you can insert data into this table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Position, Salary)
VALUES (1, 'Amit Sharma', 'Developer', 60000.00);
```

To retrieve data, you use the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

This command selects and returns all columns and rows from the `Employees` table. You can also filter what you want to see:

```sql
SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Position = 'Developer';
```

This only fetches names and salaries of employees who are developers.

SQL is also used to update existing data:

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 65000.00
WHERE ID = 1;
```

Or delete rows:

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 1;
```

One of SQL’s strengths is how it allows you to **join** data from multiple related tables using relationships (like foreign keys). This makes SQL powerful for applications like reporting, analytics, and data management.

SQL is supported by almost all major database systems like **MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle**, and **SQLite**. While the core syntax remains similar across these platforms, some systems add their own custom extensions.

In summary, SQL is a fundamental tool for anyone working with databases. Whether you're a developer, analyst, or data scientist, learning SQL gives you direct control over your data and the power to extract insights efficiently.
